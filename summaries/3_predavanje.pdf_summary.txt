### Summary and Explanations of Network Analysis Concepts

#### 1. **Definition of a Network (Graph)**  
   - A **network** (or graph) is formally defined as \( G(N, L) \), where:  
     - \( N \): A set of **nodes** (vertices, points).  
     - \( L \): A set of **links** (edges, connections) between nodes.  
   - Networks can be defined by listing nodes and their connections.  
   - **Size of a network**: Number of nodes \( |N| \).  

#### 2. **Sub-network (Subgraph)**  
   - A **sub-network** or **subgraph** is a part of the original network, consisting of a subset of nodes and links.  

#### 3. **Directed vs. Undirected Networks**  
   - **Undirected networks**: Links are bidirectional (symmetrical). Example: Friendship networks.  
   - **Directed networks**: Links have a direction. Example: Influence networks (if node \( i \) influences \( j \), it doesn’t imply \( j \) influences \( i \)).  

#### 4. **Weighted Networks**  
   - **Unweighted networks**: All links have the same strength.  
   - **Weighted networks**: Links have different strengths or weights. Weighted networks can be directed or undirected.  

#### 5. **Connectedness of Networks**  
   - A network is **connected** if there is a path from any node to any other node through links.  
   - For **directed networks**, connectedness is more complex:  
     - **Weak connectivity**: If links are treated as undirected, the network is connected.  
     - **Strong connectivity**: If there is a directed path between every pair of nodes.  

#### 6. **Density of Networks**  
   - **Density** measures how many links exist compared to the maximum possible number of links.  
     - For **undirected networks**: Maximum number of links \( L_{\text{max}} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \).  
     - For **directed networks**: \( L_{\text{max}} = N^2 \).  
   - Density \( d = \frac{L}{L_{\text{max}}} \). A sparse network has \( d \ll 1 \).  
   - Real-world networks (e.g., social, traffic) are typically sparse.  

#### 7. **Centrality Measures**  
   - **Centrality** identifies the most important nodes in a network. Key measures include:  
     - **Degree**: Number of connections a node has. For directed networks, distinguish between **in-degree** (incoming links) and **out-degree** (outgoing links).  
     - **Average degree**: \( \langle k \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i k_i \).  
     - **Degree distribution**: Histogram of degrees across nodes, characterizing the network’s structure.  

#### 8. **Clustering Coefficient**  
   - **Clustering** measures how interconnected a node’s neighbors are.  
   - For a node \( i \): Clustering coefficient \( c_i = \frac{E_i}{(k_i (k_i - 1)) / 2} \), where \( E_i \) is the number of links between neighbors of \( i \).  
   - **Average clustering coefficient**: \( \langle c \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i c_i \).  
   - High clustering indicates tightly-knit communities within the network.  

#### 9. **Examples and Applications**  
   - **Social networks**: Typically have high clustering (0.2–0.4) and sparse connections.  
   - **Traffic networks**: Analysis can reveal cost-effective solutions without compromising efficiency.  
   - **Real-world networks**: Sparse and often follow specific degree distributions (e.g., scale-free networks).  

#### 10. **Practical Implications**  
   - **Degree centrality**: Identifies influential nodes (e.g., individuals with many connections).  
   - **Clustering**: Highlights community structures and local cohesion.  
   - **Density analysis**: Helps understand resource optimization in sparse networks (e.g., traffic, social media).  

### Key Formulas  
   - **Maximum links (undirected)**: \( L_{\text{max}} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \).  
   - **Maximum links (directed)**: \( L_{\text{max}} = N^2 \).  
   - **Density**: \( d = \frac{L}{L_{\text{max}}} \).  
   - **Average degree**: \( \langle k \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i k_i \).  
   - **Clustering coefficient**: \( c_i = \frac{E_i}{(k_i (k_i - 1)) / 2} \).  
   - **Average clustering**: \( \langle c \rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i c_i \).
