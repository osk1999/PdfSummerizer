### Summary and Detailed Explanations of Network Analysis Concepts

#### Matrike Sosednosti (Adjacency Matrix)
**Definition**: An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a graph. Each element \( A_{ij} \) represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \).
- **Undirected Graphs**: For undirected graphs, the matrix is symmetric (\( A_{ij} = A_{ji} \)), meaning if there is an edge from \( i \) to \( j \), there is also an edge from \( j \) to \( i \).
- **Directed Graphs**: For directed graphs, the matrix isn't necessarily symmetric (\( A_{ij} \neq A_{ji} \)), indicating the direction of the edge.
- **Weighted Graphs**: In weighted graphs, the matrix elements represent the weights of the edges instead of just 0 or 1.

#### Seznam Sosednosti (Adjacency List)
**Definition**: An adjacency list is another way to represent a graph, where each vertex stores a list of its adjacent vertices.
- **Usage**: This method is more efficient for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges compared to vertices).

#### Biparticijska Omrežja (Bipartite Networks)
**Definition**: Bipartite networks consist of two distinct sets of vertices, where edges only occur between vertices from different sets, not within the same set.
- **Examples**: Examples include networks connecting readers and books, buyers and products, or actors and movies.

#### Najkrajša Pot (Shortest Path)
**Definition**: The shortest path problem involves finding the shortest route between two vertices in a graph.
- **Measurement**: The path can be measured by the number of edges (unweighted graphs) or the sum of weights (weighted graphs).
- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex.
- **Social Distance**: In social networks, the shortest path is referred to as social distance, which is the minimal number of steps between two individuals.

#### Povprečna Najkrajša Pot (Average Shortest Path)
**Definition**: The average shortest path length is a measure of the efficiency of information transfer across a network.
- **Calculation**: It is calculated as the average of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

#### Premer Omrežja (Network Diameter)
**Definition**: The network diameter is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the network.
- **Significance**: It indicates the maximal distance between any two vertices and is relevant for assessing the overall spread or connectivity of the network.

#### Učinkovitost Omrežja (Network Efficiency)
**Definition**: Network efficiency measures how effectively a network transmits information between its vertices.
- **Calculation**: It is inversely related to the average shortest path length; higher efficiency indicates that vertices communicate more quickly.

#### Ranljivost Omrežij (Network Vulnerability)
**Definition**: Network vulnerability assesses how the efficiency of a network changes when vertices or edges are removed.
- **Implications**: It is crucial for understanding the resilience of transport, communication, and neurological networks to failures or attacks.

### Practical Applications and Cases
