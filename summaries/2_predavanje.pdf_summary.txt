### **Summary and Explanations of Network Analysis Concepts**

The material covers various aspects of network analysis, focusing on different types of networks, their applications, and fundamental graph theory concepts. Below is a detailed summary and explanation of the key topics:

---

### **1. Networks in Biology and Neuroscience**
Networks in these fields represent interactions between biological entities:
- **Nodes (Vertices):** Neurons, proteins, cells, genes, organisms, etc.
- **Edges (Links):** Interactions such as activation/inhibition, chemical signals, ecological relationships, and feeding patterns.
- **Examples:**
  - **Brain Networks:** Structural and functional connectivity of brain regions.
  - **Protein Interaction Networks:** Interactions between proteins in organisms like *S. cerevisiae*.
  - **Gene Networks:** Gene regulatory networks, e.g., in *E. coli*.
- **Applications:** Understanding biological processes, disease mechanisms, and bioinformatics advancements.

### **2. Transport/Infrastructure Networks**
These networks represent physical and logistical systems:
- **Nodes:** Cities, train/bus stations, airports, power plants, telecommunication hubs.
- **Edges:** Roads, railways, flight paths, electrical cables, telephone lines.
- **Examples:**
  - **Bus Systems:** Bus networks in Nové Mesto vs. Berlin’s S-Bahn.
  - **Highways:** European road networks.
  - **Railways:** Slovenian railway network.
  - **Air Traffic:** Daily air traffic in Europe and globally.
- **Infrastructure Networks:**
  - **Telephone Calls:** Communication patterns and forensic applications.
  - **Power Grids:** Electrical networks in the USA.
  - **Gas Distribution:** European gas pipeline networks.
  - **Water Supply:** Water distribution systems in American cities.

### **3. Other Networks**
These include diverse systems modeled as networks:
- **Nodes:** Any units within a system.
- **Edges:** Interactions or relationships between units.
- **Examples:**
  - **Syntactic Networks:** Words as nodes, sentence order as edges.
  - **Semantic Networks:** Words as nodes, word associations as edges.
  - **Sports Networks:** Basketball players as nodes, passing the ball as edges.
  - **Culinary Networks:** Ingredients as nodes, co-occurrence in dishes as edges.

### **4. Basics of Graph Theory**
Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for analyzing networks:
- **Network (Graph):** A set \( G(N, L) \), where:
  - \( N \) = Nodes (vertices).
  - \( L \) = Edges (links, arcs).
- **Directed vs. Undirected Networks:**
  - **Undirected:** Symmetric edges (e.g., friendships).
  - **Directed:** Asymmetric edges (e.g., follower relationships on Twitter).
- **Weighted Networks:**
  - **Unweighted:** All edges have equal significance.
  - **Weighted:** Edges have varying strengths or capacities.
- **Four Main Network Forms:**
  1. Undirected, unweighted.
  2. Undirected, weighted.
  3. Directed, unweighted.
  4. Directed, weighted.

### **5. Network Connectivity**
Connectivity describes how nodes are linked within a network:
- **Connected Network:** A path exists between any two nodes.
- **Strong vs. Weak Connectivity:** Directed networks may be strongly or weakly connected.
- **Components:** Subnetworks that are internally connected but disconnected from the rest.
- **Giant Component:** The largest connected subnetwork in a fragmented system.

---

### **6. Subnetworks**
A subnetwork (subgraph) is a subset of nodes and edges from a larger network.

---

### **7. Spatial vs. Topological Networks**
- **Spatial Networks:** Nodes and edges have physical locations (e.g., roads, neurons).
- **Topological Networks:** Nodes and edges are abstract (e.g., social networks).

---

### **8. Applications of Network Analysis**
Network analysis is crucial for:
- Understanding the structure and dynamics of complex systems.
- Identifying key nodes (e.g., hubs in transportation or biology).
- Modeling interactions in social, biological, and technological systems.

### **Exam Practice Questions**
1. Define a network and explain the difference between directed and undirected networks.
2. Provide examples of biological and transport networks, and explain their nodes and edges.
3. Discuss the concepts of connectivity and components in a network.
4. What are weighted networks, and how do they differ from unweighted networks?
5. Explain the difference between spatial and topological networks.

By mastering these concepts, you will be well-prepared to analyze and describe networks in various contexts for your exams.
