   - **Email Communication**: Primary mode of communication. Emails should include "AO" in the subject line.
   - **Consultations**: Available by appointment.
   - **Forum Use**: For broader topics relevant to all students, discussions can be held on the course forum.

#### 9. **Fundamental Concepts of Networks**
   - **Definition of a Network**: A network is a set of nodes (N) connected by links (L). It can be represented as a graph G(N, L).
   - **Nodes and Links**: 
     - **Nodes**: Entities such as people, companies, websites, neurons, airports, etc.
     - **Links**: Relationships or connections such as friendships, business relationships, biological interactions, traffic flows, etc.
     - **Directed vs. Undirected Links**: Links can be one-way (directed) or two-way (undirected).
     - **Weighted Links**: Links can have weights representing strength or capacity.

#### 10. **Applications of Networks**
   - **Social Networks**: Examples include friendships, family relationships, collaborations in science or film, political networks, etc.
   - **Information Networks**: Such as the internet, Wikipedia, and email networks.
   - **Biological Networks**: Neuronal networks, genetic interaction networks.
   - **Transportation Networks**: Road networks, airline routes.
   - **Other Networks**: Financial networks, political alliances, etc.

#### 11. **Specific Examples of Networks**
   - **Real Social Networks**: Examples include friendships in schools, sororities, and corporate structures.
   - **Virtual Social Networks**: Platforms like Facebook, Twitter (X), and other social media.
   - **Scientific Collaboration Networks**: Networks formed by co-authorships in scientific publications.
   - **Film Networks**: Networks of actors and their collaborations in movies.
   - **Literary Networks**: Networks of characters in novels (e.g., "Les Misérables").
   - **Historical Networks**: Networks of medieval Florentine families with the Medici family at the center.
   - **Epidemiological Networks**: Networks showing the spread of diseases.
   - **Political Networks**: Networks of alliances between countries or political interactions on social media.

#### 12. **Information Networks**
   - **Internet**: A global network of interconnected computers, providing access to a vast array of information and services like the World Wide Web (WWW), email, VoIP (e.g., Skype).
   - **WWW vs. Internet**:
     - **Internet**: The physical infrastructure of computers and connections.
     - **WWW**: The collection of web pages, documents, and information hosted on the internet.
   - **Social vs. Information Networks**: Social networks involve people and their relationships, while information networks involve data and its connections (e.g., email networks, Wikipedia).

#### 13. **Network Analysis Techniques**
   - **Centrality Measures**: Identifying the most influential nodes in a network.
   - **Community Detection**: Finding groups or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally.
   - **Programming Networks**: Implementing network representations and algorithms in Python.

#### 14. **Key Takeaways**
